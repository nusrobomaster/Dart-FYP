## 1. Foreground
The projectile is the primary payload of the DART system...
(and so on...)

## 1. Foreground
The projectile is the primary payload of the DART system...
...requiring a rigorous development process involving iterative design and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis.

A critical step before simulation was to establish the environmental base parameters...
...a key design requirement was to ensure projectile stability in the presence of crosswinds, departing from the initial client assumption of a static-air environment.

For the design of the projectile, we decided to adopt a **first-principles design methodology**...
...Our first prototypes were a rapid exploration of basic concepts.

### Iteration Path:

* **Passive projectile design:**
    * V1 (Thorn) → V3(Crossblade) ✅
* **Parallel investigation (Conceptual Detour):**
    * V2 (Glider) ❌
* **Active projectile design:**
    * V4(Xwing) → V5(Xwing 2) → V6(Trident) → V7(Hunter) ✅
