# 🎯 FYP Dart Launcher (RoboMaster Competition)

This repository hosts the STM32 firmware for our Final Year Project (FYP), which focuses on building the **dart launcher subsystem** for the NUS RoboMaster competition robot. The project is developed and maintained using **STM32CubeIDE** with the DEV A environment, ensuring consistent toolchain and configuration across all team members.
